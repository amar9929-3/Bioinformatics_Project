- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):

 - Tool: ChatGPT; GPT-4
 - Asked: A way to simulate data from our dataset that preserves relationships and correlation using statistical parameters.
 - Snippet: Can you generate simulated data from this dataset using key statistical parameters (min, max, preserved correlations, etc) and keeping the same sample number; give me the version of the code that conditions numeric simulation on each categorical group
 - Changed: Data upload portion of code so I am prompted to choose the desired file
 - Verified: Compared original and simulated data averages and other statistical paramters
